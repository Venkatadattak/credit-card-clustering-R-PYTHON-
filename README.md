# credit-card-clustering-R-PYTHON-
The clustering analysis on credit card data to develop customer segmentation and to define marketing strategy Edwisor
1.1 Problem Statement<br>
This case requires trainees to develop a customer segmentation to define<br>
marketing strategy. The sample dataset summarizes the usage behaviour of about<br>
9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer<br>
level with 18 behavioural variables. I found that there are four types of purchase<br>
behaviour so I decided to cluster based on their purchase behaviour.<br>
